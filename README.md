# Text-Fabric-tutorials

These tutorials introduce new users to Python and the Python module Text-Fabric. The overall purpose is to guide new users to querying ancient text corpora, in particular the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.

The Hebrew Bible is stored in the openly accessible [ETCBC-database](https://github.com/ETCBC) through [Text-Fabric](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/)

## Main topics
* Launching Text-Fabric
* Basic Python (interested users, however, are encouraged to take actual Python-courses)
* Navigating the ETCBC-database
* Querying and extracting data
* Data export into standard formats (CSV)
* Basic statistical, distributional analyses
